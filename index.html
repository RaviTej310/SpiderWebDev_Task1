<h1>Hi. I'm Ravi.</h1><hr>
<h4>Welcome to my webpage.</h4><br>
<h5>A little about me:</h5>
<p>I was born in Germany and lived in Melbourne, Australia for 8 years. I returned to India in 2007 and now live in Hyderabad. After I graduate, I want to
do my Masters preferably in the U.S. In these four years, I wish to learn more about web and app dev which I have come to realise, interest me the most.
